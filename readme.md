# Testing [Ocaml Language](https://ocaml.org/)

This is a test that I've done using ocaml language, it's just a test, I just had a curiosity to try Ocaml and Here I am.

If you want to try this too, I recommend you to install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) and than start doing [this tutorial](https://ocaml.org/docs/first-hour). You can also try this online using [this website](https://try.ocamlpro.com/).

Happy Hacking ðŸ˜Š
